            <h2>Positive Effects</h2>

            <br>
            <!-- Content goes here -->

            Reading fanstasy books allow the readers to take on different ways of seeing the world in different situations.
            This allows the readers to take information from the book and make connections to the real world. In fantasy worlds
            the the “fantasy” elements of the novel are technological, although the imagined high-tech surveillance techniques described 
            are only a slight exaggeration of what current technology allows. Fantasy books can also give kids the notions of good and 
            evil are more complex. Not only does it give good benifits it is often the time is kids will go read a fantasy book without having
            to be bribed by a parent.

            <br><br>

            <i>The Graveyard Book (2008)</i> is a victorian influenced book about a boy named bod whose parents were killed when he was 
            young. So he was raised by ghosts in a nearby graveyard. The same morals that are in <i>The Jungle Book</i> are The 
            Graveyard. Fantasy books have become a more common among the youth. Such as the books hunger games and Twilight.

            <h2>Negative Effects</h2>
            <!-- Put words here -->
            Though there are positives there is still negatives. There has been times when kids dont take the story or hidden meaning
            out of the book. Whicj means they can't apply that knowledge to experences they may have. Another chance is that the youth will
            begin to mix up the reality vs imaginary worlds. Which can put those people in situations that are not the best.

            <br><br>

            Some fantasy books that mention or imply offenders in the book. Some kids will think or start to believe that this act is ok, and 
            will start to mimick that act. Which is not good but can be avoided. There are times that kids moral compass could get mixed up.
            Switching from a nice, loveing child to a rude, and angry child. They may even become void of connect to emotions.
