            <!-- Content goes here -->
            When kids have been presented with a seris of storybooks and are told to judge weather or not the event could happen in real life.
            Most kids correctly identified the impossible events. Such as chareacters walking through walls. This shows that most kids judge on
            the side of skepticism. Even when tested against supernatural events 4 years olds are very skeptical towards the supernatural or 
            divine intervention.

            <br><br>

            cartoons or other shows based upon fanstasy. At times these shows can even boost ther self-regulation skills. Also might improve
            thier memory performance.
