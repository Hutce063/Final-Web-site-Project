            <h2>What is fantasy?</h2>
            <!-- Content goes here -->
            Fantasy is what we belive. Such as dragons, fairies, supernatural beings, and many other things. The main point is that fantasy means
            things that don't exist in this world. It can lead to kids not getting bored waiting on something, they are using their 
            imagination to entertain themselves. Have you ever had an imaginary friend. Well they are a product of your imagination. 
            <br><br>
            There are different levels of fantasy.

            <li>Low Fantasy</li>
            <li>High and Epic Fantasy</li>

            <li>Sword and Sorcerery</li>
            <li>Dark Fantasy</li>
            <li>Fables</li>
            <li>Fairy tales</li>
            <li>Superhero Fiction</li>
            <br>
            Each of these bringing their own effect. Lets take low fantasy, it has all characteristics of the real world but has a small change. Such as a plastic toy coming to life. Fairy tales
            are what we read children to bed. They are set in a distant world usually starting with "Once upon a time". Now dark fantast is a 
            mix of elements from fantasy and horror stories.

            <h2>Orgins of Fantasy</h2>

            Ninetheenth Century is where modern fantasy began following the period of chivalrous European romances and 
            tales whose fantastical elements were still considered somewhat believable. There was a scottish author named George MacDonald,
            whose noval <i>Phantastes</i> (1858) featured a young man who was drawn into a dream world where he has a series of adventures.
            That book is credited with the writing the first plainly fictitious fantasy for adults. The book that set to genre fantasy. The 
            book is called <i>The Well at the World's End</i>(1896) written by Englishman William Morris. This book set the fantasy genre
            into effect because he had created a whole entire world that existed beyond the known world.
            <br><br>
            Since them Fantasy has grown im popularity. Just think for a minute. Where would we be without J.K Rowling's <i>Harry Potter</i> 
            novels (1997-2007)? Now even Hollywood is adapting many different fanstasy stories into great films and tv shows. Such as 
            <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> by British author C. S. Lewis.
